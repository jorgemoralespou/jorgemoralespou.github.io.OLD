               <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description">In this blog, I'm going to describe what are my requirements when looking for a way to develop locally using OpenShift</p>
               <!--
               <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><div class="paragraph">
<p>In this blog, I&#8217;m going to describe what are my requirements when looking for a way to develop locally using OpenShift, and I&#8217;ll describe a tool I have created to help me with this workflow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First of all, I have to say that I&#8217;m not only a developer, so maybe the workflow I&#8217;m looking for is too complex, so I&#8217;m still experimenting to refine not only the workflow but also the tooling. I&#8217;ll give some comments on what I would like from my ideal tool.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, I need to say that this workflow is to work on OpenShift, as a developer, as an evangelist, as a product manager, as a tester, as a customer, as a user and the many roles I have throughout my day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll use oc-cluster as the name of the command to show my needs. Why I used this name? Read to the end and I&#8217;ll give you an answer and also a reason why the name will eventually change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, I want an easy way to start and stop an OpenShift install locally, on my laptop.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster up
oc-cluster down</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m somehow biased by some of the option names used by Vagrant, as I&#8217;ve been a Vagrant user for many years, and still am, and I think some of the command names fits really well to be self descriptive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One important thing for me is that the cluster I create will survive multiple days, as I will be using it for a while, so I need it to be persistent. That means that if I need a new cluster, I&#8217;ll have to delete the current one, with:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster destroy</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another important factor for me as I&#8217;m multitasked, is to be able to have different clusters, with different stuff, that I can switch between them at will, so I have used the term <strong>profile</strong> for this, and when starting, stoping and destroying a cluster I can use the profile name.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster up java
oc-cluster down
oc-cluster up demo
oc-cluster down
oc-cluster destroy demo</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While I can have everything in one single cluster, in different projects, if I end up adding a lot of applications to a cluster, the amount of resources I would use, and the time it would take to start would be high, so I&#8217;d rather split my clusters into different responsibilities. I can create a cluster for Java development, configure it with a nexus artifact repository manager, and have templates configured to always use nexus, or have a buildOverrides for that. If I started a demo cluster, I would not be interfered by the work I do as a Java developer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, as there can be multiple profiles, I need a way to know what profiles I have created, so I can pass the appropriate name to the <strong>up</strong> command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster list</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, it&#8217;s very important to know if I already have a cluster up and running and which cluster is it:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster status</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far, this is a basic workflow to start and stop, create and destroy, list and status the clusters I have.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One important note is that since the create and start command is the same, the command needs to make sure that the first time is invoked will create the cluster, but the subsequent calls will just bring it up, and not do any creational steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, some of the needs that as a developer on OpenShift I have are to work with persistence volumes, so there are helper commands that helps on that goal.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster create-volume volumeName [size|10Gi] [path|$HOME/.oc/profiles/{profile}/volumes/{volumeName}]
oc-cluster create-shared-volume project/volumeName [size|10Gi] [path|$HOME/.oc/volumes/{volumeName}]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first command will create an OpenShift PV, that is only available to the profile in use, that means that whenever I destroy the cluster represented by that profile, all the date stored in that volume will be removed as well. Like every developer, I expect that all the defaults are good enough for me to use, so I limit the amount of required params to just the name. This could also be reduced to use random names, and it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ll think about.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second command, bring the difference that provides a shared storage between clusters. This way I can mount the same volume on multiple clusters. The main use case I have so far is to be used by persistent applications that I use in many clusters and that are used as infrastructure type of services. A good example for this is nexus artifact repository manager, where I want every dependency that I have already pulled down to be available to every cluster I use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, talking about OpenShift, I will probably want to get into the OpenShift runner. What I mean with the OpenShift runner is the place where OpenShift is actually running, whether this is a VM or a docker container, and I want to do this in a consistent way and in a way that I will understand. For this I use:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster ssh</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, I&#8217;ll talk about some of the problems that my clusters could suffer and some solutions to those:</p>
</div>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Adding functionality to the tool.</p>

</li>
<li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll try to dive into all these topics, one by one.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_adding_functionality_to_the_tool">Adding functionality to the tool</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes I find that what I can do, or what I want to do, is not covered by the tool, and I understand that also my use case can be quite different from other&#8217;s use cases. To solve this, the tool needs to support the ability to provide plugins that will help on different tasks. These tasks can be:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bootstrapping tasks. Adding stuff to the cluster. Whether it&#8217;s configuration or deployments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New commands. Having commands that extend how the tool works, and that are not considered bootstrapping but more management.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_bootstrapping_users">Bootstrapping users</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users is a key part of local development environments, but it&#8217;s more important when you want to use the local development environment for demos, as you&#8217;ll probably want to have different users, with different roles and belonging to different projects, so you can show things like application promotions, or the difference way of working of a developer compared to an administrator.
For me, one of the most important parts, now that it is possible, is to have my regular user act as a <strong>sudoer</strong>, so I can just execute admin commands if I need to without needing to change user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can be done by adding your user the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user sudoer developer</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
My user is developer.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, I will probably need to log in as administrator to the web interface, so I need a full user with cluster-admin role.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin admin</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
This action needs to be done as a system:admin, but the tooling we&#8217;ve built take care of this.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally I want to be able to create/delete users, and force them roles, so I can bootstrap a demo cluster for things like application promotions. I need some simple commands that will be able to bootstrap whatever is needed for me, no matter what underlying identity provider is used.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster create-user {username} {role} [{project}]
oc-cluster remove-user {username}
oc-cluster login {username}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll probably be wondering why there&#8217;s a login and logout commands. This are needed as usually one can have multiple clusters created, with the same configuration, but sadly every cluster you create will have it&#8217;s own self signed certificates for authenticating. There&#8217;s a need to set in the local oc context the proper cluster and certificates, to avoid errors. This is handled by the <strong>login</strong> command. As this is a <strong>local</strong> environment, security is not much of a concern, and passwords can be generalized.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_bootstrapping_the_cluster">Bootstrapping the cluster</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Following with the things that need to be done are the need to provide some bootstrapping for the clusters, as there will be things I will need always to be provisioned/available in certain clusters.
For this, I think that it&#8217;s important to have 2 possibilities, when creating clusters. First of all, is to blueprinting a cluster, so that every time you create a cluster with a certain blueprint, all the bootstrapping will be provided. And additionally, there needs to be a way to bootstrap one-shot clusters, for things you don&#8217;t want so frequently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To these, you have blueprints, that will be executed on cluster first bootstrap:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster up {profile_name} {blueprint}
oc-cluster up demo pipelines-demo</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Or you can do the provisioning afterwards, as a one-shot, as this will be executed in the same way:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster provision {blueprint}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How do you know what blueprints you have?</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster blueprints-list</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All blueprints can be made composable, so there can be a repository with single actions (enable-pipelines, add-user, add-project, deploy-app) or a composed action (pipelines-demo,msa-demo,&#8230;&#8203;)</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_configuration_bootstrap">Configuration bootstrap</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Configuration bootstrapping is the one that requires changes in master or node config&#8217;s file or any other configuration file and that probably will require a restart of the OpenShift process.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_deployments_bootstrap">Deployments bootstrap</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deployments bootstrap does not require to restart any process as it will only interact with OpenShift deployable resources, like projects, users, services, routes, deployments, and off course, pulling down all the required images.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_reproducibility">Reproducibility</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most important things when developing is that you know that at some point we can screw our environment, and will need to start over. There&#8217;s times where we know the action we&#8217;re going to do can be problematic, and we could probably make a safe point, so if we do something wrong, we can easily revert back the state. This is easy if you just save the configuration to be able to revert back.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster snapshot-save</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the event of a problem, you&#8217;ll might want to go back to a safe configuration:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster snapshot-list
oc-cluster snapshot-restore {snapshot-id}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
For simplicity, snapshots are made only on running clusters, but can be restored if there&#8217;s no running cluster or the cluster running is the one for the snapshot.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This concept of making save points can be greatly extended, and also is prone to errors if when you restore an environment some images are no longer available. This problem is mostly for self built images.
One extension to this concept is having the ability to provide local snapshots, that will be removed if the cluster is removed, and global snapshots, that can be used to recreate a cluster at any moment, and could be made transportable. And this leads us to our next topic.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_packaging_transport">Packaging/Transport</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Packaging of a cluster is a concept very important for when doing workshops. I do want 40 people in a room to have the exact same thing so I can teach them a lesson and they can experiment themselves. For this, there&#8217;s no easy solution, but as long as they have the tooling, a full cluster can be fully automated for a workshop. How?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Providing a download link that will do the installation/bootstrapping of all the needed things, a-la installer. So really there&#8217;s no transport, but there&#8217;s a way to bootstrap the same package for everyone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This, that sounds really cool and easy, it&#8217;s the most complex of all the tasks, and it is mainly because of the variety of operating systems existing out there. If I just had to focus on mac and linux, it could be very simple, but having to also support windows users it becomes an impossible. At least for me. Hence this requirement is not yet fulfilled.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster install {URL}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_using_proxies">Using proxies</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And last but not least, the support for proxies. This one, that seems easy, is also one of the most complex topics, and this is mostly because the support that OpenShift provides for proxies is not transportable. I&#8217;ll explain myself better. As a developer, I might need to work some time at the office, where I have a proxy to access the internet. At home I might not need the proxy. This scenario is not easily solved in OpenShift, where you&#8217;d need to play with ENV variables being set/unset for every build/deployment every time you move in or out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My idea would be something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster enable-proxy {proxy}
oc-cluster disable-proxy</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But as easy as it looks, I haven&#8217;t figured out yet if this is possible, and how.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As I said at the beginning, I&#8217;m using a command called <strong>oc-cluster</strong> and it&#8217;s because it uses internally OpenShift&#8217;s <strong>oc</strong> client tool and the <strong>cluster</strong> option. I found this <strong>oc cluster</strong> a good way to bootstrap and use a cluster locally on my <strong>mac</strong> but even on <strong>linux</strong> as it can use Docker native. If you decide to use <strong>docker-machine</strong> my command will not work. There&#8217;s many advantages to using docker locally, but there&#8217;s also some disadvantages. Hopefully the disadvantages can be easily solved but the advantages can not be easily taken with other approaches, as when using <strong>docker-machine</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Advantages I see:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can use your local file system for persistent volumes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don&#8217;t have a virtualization layer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Image are directly available to all the clusters once pulled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can share volumes between different clusters, even if they are not running.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Disadvantages I see:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Packaging and transportation with VM could be made easy, but then, there&#8217;s many virtualization out there to make it work on all, or the most important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removal of built images is easier, as the images are built into the VM. Deleting the VM, deletes all built images. This can also be solved with the tooling, as there is a feature coming that will provide labels to the images created, so every cluster will label their images. Removing the cluster, will remove their images.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Probably there&#8217;s more, but these are the ones I can think of right now.</p>

<h2 id="_options">Options</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are some options out there, some of them more portable, but also, less flexible. As I&#8217;m developing this tool just for me, I focus on something that will work for me, but as I think that most of what works for me could be made work for anyone, I&#8217;m here sharing these thoughts with you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Options:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>CDK, ADB</strong>: Using Virtualization through Vagrant and using vagrant plugins. It&#8217;s portable but very heavy weight and outdated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>OpenShift.org All-in-one</strong>: Same as before. Although it&#8217;s up to date and it doesn&#8217;t use plugins it&#8217;s heavyweight. Even I&#8217;m the author of it, I know it has many limitations, and I&#8217;m just limiting the use of it to those use cases I can not still cover, like doing workshops with Windows users :-(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minishift</strong>: It uses lightweight virtualization, but still don&#8217;t provide many of the additional features I need. I would used it and extend it, but since it&#8217;s written in go, I can not contribute to it. I find this a great option, probably the best. Although I don&#8217;t like the name of the commands used, I think will be the way to move forward, and also it is based on <strong>minikube</strong>, which seems to have adoption on <strong>Kubernetes</strong> community, which is also great. The maintainer is a great guy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plain oc cluster</strong>: This provides a great foundation, but in no way is something usable per se for developers. Just having a default that makes configuration ephemeral is something that for a developer is not interesting. But as the tool is a great cluster bootstrapper, I use it, and try to ask for features that will make developer&#8217;s use case through our tool more interesting and easy. Also the maintainer is a great guy.</p>

</ul>

<p>I love OpenShift, I love Kubernetes. I think it is a great platform to run your containers at scale, but I still see that for developers there&#8217;s a steep learning and usability curve. I hope that one day, Java developers (well really any developer) will deploy locally on Kubernetes/OpenShift and not plain docker. Also that they keep developing in plain Java, using their IDEs, building their artifacts or images however they want (s2i, docker build on OpenShift or maven and docker build locally), but that the proces it&#8217;s easy for them to use.
I think that for them to adopt a platform like this, the development process needs to be:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Easy. Not many additional steps to use the local platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fast. It needs to be as fast as without using the local platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrated. They can use the same tools to work on their local platform.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is one of the required steps to have an environment (local platform) to use. Following should be to be easy to collaborate between your local and remote environments. But that, should be the topic of another post.</p>

<p>In a real world, your applications will be transitioning from environment to environment, from development to testing and into production, as part of their lifecycle. In a container world, applications are assembled into one or many container images, hence what will be promoted are images.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this blog I will demonstrate <a href="http://blog.openshift.com/configuring-your-application-part-1">the concepts we learnt about externalizing configuration</a> in your image promotion scenarios.
As Veer <a href="https://blog.openshift.com/promoting-applications-across-environments/">has previously showed</a>, OpenShift is a platform where we can easily model the concept of stages/environments per application, and we can promote an application (image) from environment to environment just by tagging it accordingly in the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, I will be using the same application I used before, and I will create two projects simulating two different stages/environments for my application:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>node-app-dev</strong> will model the development stage and will be owned by user <strong>dev</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>node-app-test</strong> will model the testing stage and will be owned by user <strong>test</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This application will be deployed with the exact same BuildConfig in both projects, but for each, a different configuration will be used by means of deploying different values in the ConfigMap. dev user, will have an additional task of building the application from source before deploying it.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>These commands will create a new project called node-app-dev, as user dev, and will deploy a ConfigMap, with a message and background color that will be used in development environment.

<p>Now, as user <strong>test</strong>, we will create a ConfigMap with different contents,  reflecting our test environment , but we will use exactly the same DeploymentConfig like before.

               <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><div class="paragraph">
<p>Kubernetes 1.2, released more than a month ago, has brought many interesting additions to the Kubernetes platform, but there’s one, that relates to configuration management, that’s especially relevant for application developers, this is <a href="http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/configmap/">ConfigMap</a>. In this blog entry I will share some experiences and tips on using ConfigMap that goes beyond what one of our engineers and Kubernetes contributor, Paul Morie, recently <a href="http://blog.kubernetes.io/2016/04/configuration-management-with-containers.html">blogged about it</a>. We will take advantage of this new feature in a real application that we will be promoting through different environments, from development through testing into production.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the challenges that we face as developers is the need to externalize application configuration as this will probably be different per environment or per deployment. In OpenShift, Docker, and Kubernetes, developers have been externalizing this configuration into Environment variables, allowing every deployment to have different values for runtime configuration. This has been a fantastic way to adhere to the third rule of the <a href="http://12factor.net/">12factor</a> methodology, “<a href="http://12factor.net/config">store config in the environment</a>”. When you think that what we, as users of OpenShift, are deploying into the platform is not a container but rather an application, that can be composed of one or multiple containers, we understand that the configuration per deployment really spans greater context than the container itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We need a way of having all the configuration used/needed per application centralized, so that changes in configuration will not impact the definition of the deployment. This is what ConfigMap is for.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The official <a href="http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/configmap/">Kubernetes documentation</a> states:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many applications require configuration via some combination of config files, command line arguments, and environment variables. These configuration artifacts should be decoupled from image content in order to keep containerized applications portable. The ConfigMap API resource provides mechanisms to inject containers with configuration data while keeping containers agnostic of Kubernetes. ConfigMap can be used to store fine-grained information like individual properties or coarse-grained information like entire config files or JSON blobs.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, what type of configuration can we provide to an application or deployment?
It will typically fall under one of these categories:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Single configuration value expressed as an environment variable for the container.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Command line arguments in a container.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple configuration values typically set in a configuration file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s explore how we can use ConfigMaps:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I will demonstrate ConfigMap with a simple node.js app. This application will print a message as body content and will have background color configurable. We will externalize configuration into a ConfigMap. The code for the application is on <a href="https://github.com/jorgemoralespou/ose-app-promotion-configmap/blob/master/node-app/server.js">GitHub</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First required thing is to create a ConfigMap to hold the configuration values you want to make available to the deployment. My node.js application will get it’s background color from a property named “color” in a file named “/etc/node-app/node-app.config” in the container. It will also, look for an environment property named message for a string to be show as background message.
The configuration file contents that will be used is:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">color=blue</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s create a ConfigMap, named <strong>config</strong>, with both a literal text, message=<strong>Hello world!</strong>, and the configuration file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ oc create configmap config \
            --from-literal=message=’Hello world!’ \
            --from-file=ui.properties
configmap "config" created</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s verify the contents of our ConfigMap.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">$ oc get configmap/config -o json
{
    "kind": "ConfigMap",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "config",
    },
    "data": {
        "message": "Hello world!",
        "ui.properties": "color=blue\n"
    }
}</code></pre>

<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
Some internal metadata has been removed from output for brevity.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that I have a ConfigMap with the configuration my application requires, I’m going to deploy an application that will make use of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my <a href="https://github.com/jorgemoralespou/ose-app-promotion-configmap/blob/master/node-app/server.js">sample app</a>, I will consume the configuration provided by the ConfigMap, mapping the ConfigMap property <strong>message</strong> to the environment variable <strong>BACKGROUND_MSG</strong> the application expects, and also mapping the <strong>ui.properties</strong> into a file located in <strong>/etc/node-app/node-app.config</strong>.</p>

<p>Configuration is assembled at deployment time, so when the application is deployed and there is no ConfigMap that satisfies the DeploymentConfig, we will have a warning event in our Event log that will help us diagnose the misconfiguration that prevented the deployment to start:</p>

<p>One important thing to know is, when a ConfigMap is mounted as a volume, we can change the contents of the ConfigMap, and the mounted file in the container will be eventually updated, when the kubelet on the node re-synchs the pod, providing for changes in configuration in running containers. The running application needs to provide a mechanism to reload configuration changes when they happen.</p>

<p>In this blog we have demonstrated a way of externalizing configuration of an application. Remember, ConfigMaps are GA in Kubernetes 1.2 and OpenShift 3.2 and some improvements are still to come. Just take these simple <strong>restrictions</strong> into account:</p>

<p>We launched OpenShift 3.0 back in June 2015 and I have had the pleasure of speaking with users all over Europe and the EMEA region to help them get up and running with deploying applications on the platform. One of the features that developers and administrator often ask questions about are Service Accounts and Security Context Constraints. In this blog post, I will provide a simple introduction into both concepts, how they work and their usage.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_security_context_constraints_scc">Security Context Constraints (SCC)</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#security-context-constraints">official documentation states</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenShift provides security context constraints (SCC) that control the actions that a pod can perform and what it has the ability to access.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In short, when we execute a container, we want to guarantee that the capabilities required by that container to run are satisfied, while at the same time we also want OpenShift to be a secure Container Application platform. For this reason we can not allow any container to get access to unnecessary capabilities or to run in an insecure way (e.g. privileged or as root).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenShift guarantees that the capabilities required by a container are granted to the user that executes the container at <a href="https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#admission">admission time</a>. Admission is done based on the identity of the user executing the pod and the pod’s service account (introduced later in this blog).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OpenShift Container Application Platform provides a set of predefined Security Context Constraints that can be used, modified or extended by any administrator. The SCCs that can be used are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

<h2 id="_service_accounts">Service Accounts</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/service_accounts.html">official documentation states</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a person uses the command line or web console, their API token authenticates them to the OpenShift API. However, when a regular user’s credentials are not available, it is common for components to make API calls independently. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Replication controllers make API calls to create or delete pods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applications inside containers could make API calls for discovery purposes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>External applications could make API calls for monitoring or integration purposes</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Service accounts provide a flexible way to control API access without sharing a regular user’s credentials</strong>.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see, there are many use cases for Service Accounts, and if we dive into the first use case aforementioned, we need to understand that OpenShift (and Kubernetes) are not synchronous in the execution of their commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/posts/images/sa_scc/Eventual_consistency.png" alt="Asynch state consolidation">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a user wants to deploy an application, he creates a DeploymentConfig resource, which describes a desired state (as can be seen in the picture above - step 1). From this point, a set of controllers (admission, replication controller, scheduler,&#8230;&#8203;), running on the master server, will be monitoring those definitions and will execute necessary actions on the OpenShift platform in order to provide consistency between the desired and actual state (as can be seen in the picture above - step 2). This will happen as soon as the controllers try to consolidate the cluster state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What this really means is, the actions are executed by the OpenShift controllers and not by the actual user, that expressed the desired state. This leads to the situation where we need to identify who&#8217;s executing the actions the controllers are invoking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, OpenShift creates three service accounts per project for building, deploying and running an application (see <a href="https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/service_accounts.html#default-service-accounts-and-roles">the official documentation</a> for more details).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a user creates anyobject in OpenShift it will use these default Service Accounts, but a different one can be specified within the object configuration.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">{
   "kind": "DeploymentConfig",
   "apiVersion": "v1",
   "metadata": {...},
   "spec": {
      ...
      "template": {
         ...
         "spec":{
            "containers": [
            ],
            ...
            "serviceAccountName": "myserviceaccount"
         }
      }
   }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One reason to use a dedicated service account in a deployment configuration is to allow an application running within a pod to use a set of privileges or capabilities other than those granted by the <strong>default</strong> service account. This default service account will only have access to all the capabilities defined by the <strong>restricted</strong> SCC, as out of the box OpenShift will add every authenticated user to the restricted SCC (as can bee seen in the output of the execution of “oc describe scc restricted” shown above). This includes the default service account which is not explicitly included in any other SCC.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since every service account has an associated username, it can be added to any specific SCC in a similar way as we have done previously with users and groups.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an example, we might want to run an application that needs access to mount hostPath volumes, or we might want to run an application with a specified user and not a random user OpenShift will use as default (as detailed in <a href="https://blog.openshift.com/getting-any-docker-image-running-in-your-own-openshift-cluster/">this blog</a>), or we might want to restrict the container&#8217;s filesystem to be readonly, and forcing every write to be on external storage. There are many other situations that might require us to change the capabilities provided by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This leads to the conclusion of this blog with my advice:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Every time you have an application/process that requires a capability not granted by the restricted SCC, create a new, specific service account and add it to the appropriate SCC. But, if there is no SCC that perfectly suits your needs, instead of using the best fit one, <a href="https://docs.openshift.org/latest/admin_guide/manage_scc.html#creating-new-security-context-constraints">create a new SCC</a> tailored for your requirements, and finally set it for the deployment configuration (as described above).”</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ oc create serviceaccount useroot

$ oc patch dc/myAppNeedsRoot --patch '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"serviceAccountName": "useroot"}}}}'

$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z useroot</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Above you can see my advice in action, creating a new service account named <em>useroot</em>, modifying the deployment configuration for <em>myAppNeedsRoot</em> and then adding the serviceaccount to the <em>anyuid</em> SCC as the application defined needs to run as user root in the container. Note that I haven&#8217;t created a specific SCC since anyuid meets my needs.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve seen many users granting access to a user/serviceaccount to the privileged SCC to avoid going through this exercise, and this is can be a big security problem, so take my word of caution.
&lt;/group_name&gt;&lt;/scc_name&gt;&lt;/user_name&gt;&lt;/scc_name&gt;&lt;/none&gt;&lt;/none&gt;&lt;/none&gt;&lt;/none&gt;&lt;/none&gt;&lt;/none&gt;&lt;/none&gt;&lt;/none&gt;&lt;/none&gt;&lt;/none&gt;&lt;/none&gt;&lt;/none&gt;&lt;/none&gt;&lt;/none&gt;&lt;/none&gt;&lt;/none&gt;&lt;/none&gt;&lt;/none&gt;</p>

<p>As you might know, OpenShift 3 Enterprise provides Middleware Services (xPaas), which is a set of Java based images for JBoss EAP, JBoss EWS (Tomcat), JBoss Fuse Integration Services, JBoss A-MQ, JBoss Decision Server and JBoss Data Grid. Also, OpenShift Origin provides an additional JBoss based images for Wildfly, our application server community project. All these images are <a href="https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/">source-to-image (S2I)</a> enable, that means that will get your application source code built (using Maven) and layered into the application container.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When working with Maven, it is very common to use a Central Artifact Repository Manager in your organization for centralizing and managing all the required and generated dependencies, as well as providing you with isolation from the real location of the artifacts in the Internet and some security mechanisms, amongst other features. During my life as a developer and consultant I&#8217;ve been working with Nexus Artifact Manager for this purpose. I will not say that it&#8217;s the best or worst, but only that it is the one most familiar to me, and because of that, I will be using it in my OpenShift install.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important to note that everything I will describe can be executed in OpenShift Enterprise or Origin, the only requirement is, that if you&#8217;re using the Middleware Services images you should have the corresponding subscriptions for running them.</p>

<p>The first thing we need to do is to lay out our OpenShift architecture.

It is important to note, that this Nexus server comes already configured with some Red Hat JBoss repositories, to allow our S2I images to fetch the appropriate dependencies.</p>

<p>JBoss EAP S2I Builder Image version 1.2, which is the latest version of the builder image, that comes with OpenShift Enterprise 3.1, it provides an environment variable that can be set to point to a maven mirror url, unsurprisingly it is called <strong>MAVEN_MIRROR_URL</strong>. I will use that variable to get the maven artifacts through our Nexus instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To check that our builds will use our internal nexus instance, we can browse to the public group page and verify that there is no dependency currently stored.</p>

<p>You should notice that I&#8217;ve used internal DNS name of our nexus instance, which is <strong>nexus.ci.svc.cluster.local</strong>, which follows the pattern &lt;service-name&gt;.&lt;project&gt;.svc.cluster.local for services. This is a very powerful feature of OpenShift that provides DNS names for every service, <a href="https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/additional_concepts/networking.html#openshift-dns">and much more</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When building the application, we will notice that maven dependencies are being pulled from our nexus instance, instead of the default public Red Hat JBoss' repositories.</p>

<p>Here, we can a historical view of the builds before and after setting MAVEN_MIRROR_URL. The first build in OpenShift always takes longer than any other build as it has to push all the base layers to the registry after the build. Successive builds will just push the application layer. From build #2 to #5 we can see the time it takes a normal build, without using Nexus, averaging <strong>1 minute and 13 seconds</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Build #7 introduces the change with MAVEN_MIRROR_URL set, but as this is the first build after the environment variable has been set, it still took <strong>1 minute and 8 seconds</strong> to complete. This build was populating Nexus with all the pulled down dependencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In builds #8 to #10 we can see that the average time it takes now to build is <strong>42 seconds</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As can be seen, we get an average benefit of <strong>31 seconds</strong> in building time after introducing our integration with an artifact repository manager, like Nexus.</p>

<h2 id="_modifying_the_s2i_builder">Modifying the S2I builder</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not always one can have the comfort of working with S2i builder images that expose the ability to set a Maven mirror like the Middleware Services images provided by Red Hat does, in that cases you need to think of other mechanisms to integrate these images with an artifact repository manager.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The options can vary, ranging from  the most obvious, modify or extend the builder image, using incremental builds, up to creating builder image from scratch. Since I do not like modifying existing images, especially those created by others, I will show how to extend existing Wildfly S2I Builder images to make use of a Nexus artifact repository manager. The same approach can be used with any other builder image, and some other technologies that use or can benefit from the use of an artifact repository manager, especially that Nexus or Artifactory support storing dependencies for other languages than just java.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have created a file that will install all the required resources needed to work with the Nexus instance provided in the OpenShift install. These resources are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>3 <strong>BuildConfigs</strong>, for <a href="https://github.com/jorgemoralespou/nexus-ose/blob/master/builders/wildfly-nexus/wildfly-nexus-resources.json#L8-L58">Wildfly 8</a>,  <a href="https://github.com/jorgemoralespou/nexus-ose/blob/master/builders/wildfly-nexus/wildfly-nexus-resources.json#L59-L109">Wildfly 9</a> and  <a href="https://github.com/jorgemoralespou/nexus-ose/blob/master/builders/wildfly-nexus/wildfly-nexus-resources.json#L110-L160">Wildfly 10</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6 <strong>ImageStreams</strong>, one for each of the original ImageStreams for every Wildfly version (<a href="https://github.com/jorgemoralespou/nexus-ose/blob/master/builders/wildfly-nexus/wildfly-nexus-resources.json#L110-L160">8</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jorgemoralespou/nexus-ose/blob/master/builders/wildfly-nexus/wildfly-nexus-resources.json#L110-L160">9</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jorgemoralespou/nexus-ose/blob/master/builders/wildfly-nexus/wildfly-nexus-resources.json#L228-L260">10</a>) and another one for each of the modified S2I builder images for Wildfly integrated with nexus (<a href="https://github.com/jorgemoralespou/nexus-ose/blob/master/builders/wildfly-nexus/wildfly-nexus-resources.json#L261-L283">8</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jorgemoralespou/nexus-ose/blob/master/builders/wildfly-nexus/wildfly-nexus-resources.json#L284-L305">9</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jorgemoralespou/nexus-ose/blob/master/builders/wildfly-nexus/wildfly-nexus-resources.json#L306-L327">10</a>).</p>

</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The change that I’ve done to the default Wildfly S2I builder image is as simple as <a href="https://github.com/jorgemoralespou/nexus-ose/blob/master/builders/wildfly-nexus/8.1/Dockerfile#L1-L3">providing an overloaded settings.xml file in my custom S2I builder</a> images that points to the <a href="https://github.com/jorgemoralespou/nexus-ose/blob/master/builders/wildfly-nexus/8.1/settings.xml#L17">nexus artifact repository manager</a>. This change is the easiest to prove this functionality, although probably a better option would be to provide environment variable to customize the assembly process.</p>

<p>This first build took <strong>3 minutes and 11 seconds</strong>, it includes building with the plain wildfly-9 image available on Github, and the time needed to pull down the image. This image was not doing any dependency management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the second build, I updated the BuildConfig to use wildfly-nexus-9 builder image and this build took <strong>1 minutes and 24 seconds</strong>. The reason for that is that Nexus was caching all the dependencies, since I used a clean nexus instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the third and fourth build, all the dependencies were already cached in Nexus and build time dropped to <strong>37 and 35 seconds</strong>, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As in the previous example, with EAP, we get a benefit of more than 40 seconds in our build time by using an artifact repository manager, like Nexus.</p>

<h2 id="_using_incremental_build">Using incremental build</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another option, I’ve mentioned before, we can use to improve Maven based Java builds in OpenShift is to enable the <a href="https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/dev_guide/builds.html#incremental-builds">incremental builds</a>. Unfortunately not all images support this feature, since it requires the existence of <a href="https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/creating_images/s2i.html#s2i-scripts">save-artifacts</a> script, responsible for saving artifacts used during builds. In our cases these will be maven dependencies. This will have the same behavior as having a local maven repository into the build image itself, with the drawback of reaching out for the previously built image and getting the dependencies out of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To test this mode, I have created a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorgemoralespou/nexus-ose/master/other/eap-incremental/eap-incremental-resources.json">sample resources file</a> that can be easily tested.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ oc new-project eap-incremental-builds --display-name="EAP incremental builds" --description="Building Applications in EAP using incremental build mode"

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After we&#8217;ve created the resources, let&#8217;s do some builds and look at the times.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/posts/images/speed_java_builds/eap_incremental_build.png" alt="EAP incremental build">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As can be seen in the image above, the times for the second and third build, which are the builds benefiting from the stored artifacts takes much less time, <strong>48 and 47 seconds</strong>, but it&#8217;s the same time it takes when using the artifact repository manager, so there is no additional benefit in time, although it is much simpler for those images that support incremental mode, as the developer will only need to specify <a href="https://github.com/jorgemoralespou/nexus-ose/blob/master/other/eap-incremental/eap-incremental-resources.json#L57">a flag in the BuildConfig</a>.</p>

<p>In this example, the application and pulled down dependencies are not adding a big overhead in size to the initial eap64-openshift S2I image, only 7 MB.</p>

<div class="content">
<img src="/posts/images/speed_java_builds/eap_image_sizes.png" alt="EAP incremental build">
</div>

<p>But we need to be careful with this approach as there are other images or applications that will have much more dependencies, and the size of the generated image can grow enormously. 130 MB in the following example using Fuse Integration Services.</p>

<h2 id="_summary">Summary</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For every application that we build we will be getting a performance benefit by caching into an artifact repository manager it&#8217;s dependencies. Initially we will be perceiving a performance benefit for the second and subsequent builds of every application, but as the artifact repository manager stores more and more dependencies this benefit will be also seen in initial builds of new applications, and most of the dependencies will already be cached.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, we can use incremental builds to get better performance on Java based builds, but it is important to understand that even this approach is easier to set up there are some drawbacks for this approach, like the need for the image to support incremental mode. Also, in this scenario, as the build process saves the dependencies within the image being built it means that if successive builds are run in different nodes, every node will have to first pull down the image from the OpenShift’s Docker registry which might take longer than pulling down the dependencies again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most important benefit of using Nexus or any other artifact repository dependency manager is the security and the fact that dependencies downloaded by one developer/build will be reused over all the builds using the same dependencies. Whereas in the case of incremental builds only the dependencies downloaded during previous build can be reused and only by the same build. This might have huge impact for any Java-based organization.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this blog, I&#8217;ve highlighted how we can improve the build time of Maven based Java builds in OpenShift, but also a very important topic is the use of the internal DNS service names to reference from one project to another. The only caveat to this, is that if we are using the multi-tenant OVS networking plugin, our cluster administrators will have to make visible our <strong>ci</strong> project to all other projects:</p>

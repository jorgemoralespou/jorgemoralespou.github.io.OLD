               <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description">In part 2 of this series of articles we will explore the first local development environment that existed for Openshift Origin and OpenShift 3.</p>
               <!--
               <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><div class="paragraph">
<p>At the time OpenShift started, we realized that having a local development environment was important to make iterative development work more agile. Back then, the requirements that we had for a local development environment were pretty clear:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It needs to work on linux, mac and windows</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It needs to be easy to run</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It needs to be easily disposable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resources used need to be adjustable</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was an existing technology that was meeting all these requirements, Vagrant by Hashicorp. Vagrant is a tool that allows you to start a VM, from a template, and then provision/bootstrap the VM on first boot. Then you could start and stop that VM for as many times as you want/need before you discard it. This technology provided us a way to give a base VM image, based out of Centos or RHEL, that was on first boot bootstrapped to contain a full OpenShift environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OpenShift evangelist team started this work and created what we called the “<strong>Origin all-in-one</strong>” which bootstrapped you an OpenShift Origin all-in-one node with additional content. This effort also started based on the necessity of the team to provide a way for developers to have a VM they could take home in order to learn OpenShift.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The effort lead to an official variant, called <strong>CDK (Container Development Kit)</strong> and supported by our Red Hat Developers Tools, that was based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and installed the Enterprise version of OpenShift, now called OpenShift Container Platform. It provides mostly the same capabilities as the all-in-one, but the most important fact for this variant is that Red Hat supports it. You just need to subscribe the VM (free subscription for developers) and you’ll have access to our Enterprise product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The downsides to using Vagrant is that you need to use a full Operating System VM that required an initial download of some GBs of data prior to being able to start working. Also it requires a considerable amount of resources not always easily available in the developer’s workstations or laptops.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Relying on Vagrant seemed the right approach at the time, and in the case of CDK, Red Hat invested in having a team of developers working upstream on some of the plugins used. The truth is that after some time, Vagrant seems more an abandoned project where every release breaks a feature and introduces incompatibilities with some of the versions of the hypervisors, e.g. VirtualBox which makes it complicated for the users to have it properly installed and functional.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’m not going to explain how this approach works. If you’re interested you can just look at <a href="https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/vagrant-origin/">our docs</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even though we could admit that the Origin all-in-one VM has been very successful, it has become less and less the defacto way of running a local OpenShift instance, and it will no longer be maintained, as we have <a href="https://blog.openshift.com/goodbye-openshift-all-in-one-vm-hello-minishift/">announced</a>. But don’t be afraid, that doesn’t mean there will be no solution. In the following posts I’ll be talking about more options, so stay tuned!</p>

               <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description">This is the first article of a series of blogs describing the state of the art related to local development using OpenShift as Container Application Platform</p>
               <!--
               <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenShift v3 launched a year and a half ago and during this time we’ve been looking at different ways to run a local OpenShift development environment on the developer’s laptop. In this series of articles I will be introducing the options we have been providing and most importantly, I will describe the evolution in our approach..</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But before digging into any particular solution, we need to set the ground rules of what a local development environment is and why it is important.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenShift is a Cloud Container Application Platform that will usually be installed on a datacenter for enterprise grade usage. This means that developers will have access to a set of nodes that will be acting as development environment for them. As you probably know, OpenShift runs applications packaged as Docker containers, so all that is required to use the platform is the Docker images to run. How you get to these images is not relevant for OpenShift, although it provides some mechanism out of the box that makes your life easier, what is really relevant is that your Docker image is available to the platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a developer, how can you make this happen? These are some options.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide source code to the platform and let the platform build it. There are 2 options:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide your application’s source code and let OpenShift build the Docker image using s2i.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a Dockerfile and let OpenShift build the Docker image using a Docker build for you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide just your application binary to a special image that knows how to run it. This can be done in different ways but most likely:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide your application binary to OpenShift and let OpenShift build a Docker image with the binary on top of an existing base image.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide your application binary as a parameter to your deployment that will use a generic Docker image and will pull it down at startup time. This goes against the model that the Docker image should container everything it needs, but still, is an option.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a Docker image and push it to the platform. There is multiple ways to create this Docker image, build it locally or in a CI server running internally or externally to openshift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pull down into the platform an existing Docker image. The only difference is that in this case, you will not be building the image.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But let’s step back a little. Since we are developers, it is quite important to us how we create those Docker images. The truth is that, as developers, we will be building our application and trying it out on the environment several times during the development cycle. While doing this using a clustered platform, remote to our laptops, is probably the easiest in terms of convenience, but the truth is that for most developers, like me, this will not be enough. I will probably be building the application several times a day, sometimes tens or even hundreds of times. I will probably like to debug the running application. I will probably want to do many other things that can be summarized in:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“I want to develop applications for OpenShift as fast as I can develop an application running on my local development box”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That probably means that</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>I need to be able to have the OpenShift environment as close and available to me as possible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to have a streamlined process for developing against this local OpenShift environment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While you may not agree with what I just said, I can provide some good reasoning on why I would like this kind of development environment. Of course there’s always some drawbacks, but I think they can be overcome. Let’s start with the pros on why it is good to have an OpenShift local.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Independence of location</strong>. I no longer need to be attached to the company’s network to be able to work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Independence of connectivity</strong>. I will no longer require an internet connection to work. This is not always true, but is true as long as you have your dependencies and base images locally available. And this will work especially well if you integrate your image repository or source code repository into the local OpenShift. For example, this can be accomplished with Gitlab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customization of the experience</strong>. I can customize the build experience so that it looks as close as possible to developing without OpenShift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Faster development cycle</strong>. I can iterate faster on my development, code, test, deploy, code, test, deploy, debug,&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And now, the few cons I can think of:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Solutions for multiple platforms</strong>. Developers might use Windows, Linux or Mac, so the local development environment needs to run on these Operating Systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Developer box resource requirements</strong>. Having a local OpenShift install means that the Developer Workstation needs to have enough resources to run it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Administration rights to install the tools</strong>. Sometimes we have found that developer’s workstations are standardized and they are not allowed to install additional software.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of these cons, the first one is Red Hat’s responsibility, as we should provide a solution for local development targeting these different environments. The others are something that Enterprises will need to think about when adopting new technology. As we are already in 2017 we need to understand that developers will not be productive using low resources workstations, it’s penny-wise pound foolish. I hope that at this point in time, enterprises understand that specs for developer workstations should no longer be such a big issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There’s always alternatives to running a local OpenShift instance on the developer’s box, but I can not advocate for any solution that goes against the principles of test your production code as soon as possible, which for me, that means on my workstation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most importantly,  there is multiple ways to bring your code into an application and that application to run it in your local OpenShift developer instance:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Building your application and rsync the compiled code into a running container.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rsync source code directly into a container when using non-compiled languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a maven plugin to build the images on the host and push them into you local OpenShift environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many others&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any option you take, should mean that at the end you, as a developer, can test your application running in an OpenShift environment. If on the contrary, you build and verify/test your application in a specific way that will be different as how the application will be run in production, there’s many chances that issues might occur. This should be avoided as much as possible if you want to fully embrace DevOps and agility.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that I have presented the importance of having a local OpenShift environment available in your workstation, I’ll present the evolution of the “local OpenShift development environment” since we started to the present time, when I can say we have finally a really good solution that only can get better.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the next blogs I’ll talk about the Origin all-on-one VM (and the Container Development Kit/CDK) using virtualization and Vagrant. Then I’ll move into a pure docker solution with “oc cluster up” and I’ll end up with minishift, a lightweight virtualized option.</p>

               <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description">In this blog, I'm going to describe what are my requirements when looking for a way to develop locally using OpenShift</p>
               <!--
               <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><div class="paragraph">
<p>In this blog, I&#8217;m going to describe what are my requirements when looking for a way to develop locally using OpenShift, and I&#8217;ll describe a tool I have created to help me with this workflow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First of all, I have to say that I&#8217;m not only a developer, so maybe the workflow I&#8217;m looking for is too complex, so I&#8217;m still experimenting to refine not only the workflow but also the tooling. I&#8217;ll give some comments on what I would like from my ideal tool.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, I need to say that this workflow is to work on OpenShift, as a developer, as an evangelist, as a product manager, as a tester, as a customer, as a user and the many roles I have throughout my day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll use oc-cluster as the name of the command to show my needs. Why I used this name? Read to the end and I&#8217;ll give you an answer and also a reason why the name will eventually change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, I want an easy way to start and stop an OpenShift install locally, on my laptop.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster up
oc-cluster down</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m somehow biased by some of the option names used by Vagrant, as I&#8217;ve been a Vagrant user for many years, and still am, and I think some of the command names fits really well to be self descriptive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One important thing for me is that the cluster I create will survive multiple days, as I will be using it for a while, so I need it to be persistent. That means that if I need a new cluster, I&#8217;ll have to delete the current one, with:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster destroy</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another important factor for me as I&#8217;m multitasked, is to be able to have different clusters, with different stuff, that I can switch between them at will, so I have used the term <strong>profile</strong> for this, and when starting, stoping and destroying a cluster I can use the profile name.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster up java
oc-cluster down
oc-cluster up demo
oc-cluster down
oc-cluster destroy demo</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While I can have everything in one single cluster, in different projects, if I end up adding a lot of applications to a cluster, the amount of resources I would use, and the time it would take to start would be high, so I&#8217;d rather split my clusters into different responsibilities. I can create a cluster for Java development, configure it with a nexus artifact repository manager, and have templates configured to always use nexus, or have a buildOverrides for that. If I started a demo cluster, I would not be interfered by the work I do as a Java developer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, as there can be multiple profiles, I need a way to know what profiles I have created, so I can pass the appropriate name to the <strong>up</strong> command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster list</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, it&#8217;s very important to know if I already have a cluster up and running and which cluster is it:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster status</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far, this is a basic workflow to start and stop, create and destroy, list and status the clusters I have.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One important note is that since the create and start command is the same, the command needs to make sure that the first time is invoked will create the cluster, but the subsequent calls will just bring it up, and not do any creational steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, some of the needs that as a developer on OpenShift I have are to work with persistence volumes, so there are helper commands that helps on that goal.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster create-volume volumeName [size|10Gi] [path|$HOME/.oc/profiles/{profile}/volumes/{volumeName}]
oc-cluster create-shared-volume project/volumeName [size|10Gi] [path|$HOME/.oc/volumes/{volumeName}]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first command will create an OpenShift PV, that is only available to the profile in use, that means that whenever I destroy the cluster represented by that profile, all the date stored in that volume will be removed as well. Like every developer, I expect that all the defaults are good enough for me to use, so I limit the amount of required params to just the name. This could also be reduced to use random names, and it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ll think about.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second command, bring the difference that provides a shared storage between clusters. This way I can mount the same volume on multiple clusters. The main use case I have so far is to be used by persistent applications that I use in many clusters and that are used as infrastructure type of services. A good example for this is nexus artifact repository manager, where I want every dependency that I have already pulled down to be available to every cluster I use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, talking about OpenShift, I will probably want to get into the OpenShift runner. What I mean with the OpenShift runner is the place where OpenShift is actually running, whether this is a VM or a docker container, and I want to do this in a consistent way and in a way that I will understand. For this I use:</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes I find that what I can do, or what I want to do, is not covered by the tool, and I understand that also my use case can be quite different from other&#8217;s use cases. To solve this, the tool needs to support the ability to provide plugins that will help on different tasks. These tasks can be:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bootstrapping tasks. Adding stuff to the cluster. Whether it&#8217;s configuration or deployments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New commands. Having commands that extend how the tool works, and that are not considered bootstrapping but more management.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_bootstrapping_users">Bootstrapping users</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users is a key part of local development environments, but it&#8217;s more important when you want to use the local development environment for demos, as you&#8217;ll probably want to have different users, with different roles and belonging to different projects, so you can show things like application promotions, or the difference way of working of a developer compared to an administrator.
For me, one of the most important parts, now that it is possible, is to have my regular user act as a <strong>sudoer</strong>, so I can just execute admin commands if I need to without needing to change user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can be done by adding your user the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user sudoer developer</code></pre>

<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
My user is developer.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, I will probably need to log in as administrator to the web interface, so I need a full user with cluster-admin role.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin admin</code></pre>

<td class="content">
This action needs to be done as a system:admin, but the tooling we&#8217;ve built take care of this.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally I want to be able to create/delete users, and force them roles, so I can bootstrap a demo cluster for things like application promotions. I need some simple commands that will be able to bootstrap whatever is needed for me, no matter what underlying identity provider is used.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster create-user {username} {role} [{project}]
oc-cluster remove-user {username}
oc-cluster login {username}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll probably be wondering why there&#8217;s a login and logout commands. This are needed as usually one can have multiple clusters created, with the same configuration, but sadly every cluster you create will have it&#8217;s own self signed certificates for authenticating. There&#8217;s a need to set in the local oc context the proper cluster and certificates, to avoid errors. This is handled by the <strong>login</strong> command. As this is a <strong>local</strong> environment, security is not much of a concern, and passwords can be generalized.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_bootstrapping_the_cluster">Bootstrapping the cluster</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Following with the things that need to be done are the need to provide some bootstrapping for the clusters, as there will be things I will need always to be provisioned/available in certain clusters.
For this, I think that it&#8217;s important to have 2 possibilities, when creating clusters. First of all, is to blueprinting a cluster, so that every time you create a cluster with a certain blueprint, all the bootstrapping will be provided. And additionally, there needs to be a way to bootstrap one-shot clusters, for things you don&#8217;t want so frequently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To these, you have blueprints, that will be executed on cluster first bootstrap:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster up {profile_name} {blueprint}
oc-cluster up demo pipelines-demo</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Or you can do the provisioning afterwards, as a one-shot, as this will be executed in the same way:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster provision {blueprint}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How do you know what blueprints you have?</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster blueprints-list</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All blueprints can be made composable, so there can be a repository with single actions (enable-pipelines, add-user, add-project, deploy-app) or a composed action (pipelines-demo,msa-demo,&#8230;&#8203;)</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_configuration_bootstrap">Configuration bootstrap</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Configuration bootstrapping is the one that requires changes in master or node config&#8217;s file or any other configuration file and that probably will require a restart of the OpenShift process.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_deployments_bootstrap">Deployments bootstrap</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deployments bootstrap does not require to restart any process as it will only interact with OpenShift deployable resources, like projects, users, services, routes, deployments, and off course, pulling down all the required images.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_reproducibility">Reproducibility</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most important things when developing is that you know that at some point we can screw our environment, and will need to start over. There&#8217;s times where we know the action we&#8217;re going to do can be problematic, and we could probably make a safe point, so if we do something wrong, we can easily revert back the state. This is easy if you just save the configuration to be able to revert back.</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster snapshot-save</code></pre>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the event of a problem, you&#8217;ll might want to go back to a safe configuration:</p>

For simplicity, snapshots are made only on running clusters, but can be restored if there&#8217;s no running cluster or the cluster running is the one for the snapshot.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This concept of making save points can be greatly extended, and also is prone to errors if when you restore an environment some images are no longer available. This problem is mostly for self built images.
One extension to this concept is having the ability to provide local snapshots, that will be removed if the cluster is removed, and global snapshots, that can be used to recreate a cluster at any moment, and could be made transportable. And this leads us to our next topic.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_packaging_transport">Packaging/Transport</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Packaging of a cluster is a concept very important for when doing workshops. I do want 40 people in a room to have the exact same thing so I can teach them a lesson and they can experiment themselves. For this, there&#8217;s no easy solution, but as long as they have the tooling, a full cluster can be fully automated for a workshop. How?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Providing a download link that will do the installation/bootstrapping of all the needed things, a-la installer. So really there&#8217;s no transport, but there&#8217;s a way to bootstrap the same package for everyone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This, that sounds really cool and easy, it&#8217;s the most complex of all the tasks, and it is mainly because of the variety of operating systems existing out there. If I just had to focus on mac and linux, it could be very simple, but having to also support windows users it becomes an impossible. At least for me. Hence this requirement is not yet fulfilled.</p>

<h2 id="_using_proxies">Using proxies</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And last but not least, the support for proxies. This one, that seems easy, is also one of the most complex topics, and this is mostly because the support that OpenShift provides for proxies is not transportable. I&#8217;ll explain myself better. As a developer, I might need to work some time at the office, where I have a proxy to access the internet. At home I might not need the proxy. This scenario is not easily solved in OpenShift, where you&#8217;d need to play with ENV variables being set/unset for every build/deployment every time you move in or out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My idea would be something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">oc-cluster enable-proxy {proxy}
oc-cluster disable-proxy</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But as easy as it looks, I haven&#8217;t figured out yet if this is possible, and how.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_existing_tooling">Existing tooling</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As I said at the beginning, I&#8217;m using a command called <strong>oc-cluster</strong> and it&#8217;s because it uses internally OpenShift&#8217;s <strong>oc</strong> client tool and the <strong>cluster</strong> option. I found this <strong>oc cluster</strong> a good way to bootstrap and use a cluster locally on my <strong>mac</strong> but even on <strong>linux</strong> as it can use Docker native. If you decide to use <strong>docker-machine</strong> my command will not work. There&#8217;s many advantages to using docker locally, but there&#8217;s also some disadvantages. Hopefully the disadvantages can be easily solved but the advantages can not be easily taken with other approaches, as when using <strong>docker-machine</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Advantages I see:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can use your local file system for persistent volumes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don&#8217;t have a virtualization layer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Image are directly available to all the clusters once pulled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can share volumes between different clusters, even if they are not running.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Disadvantages I see:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Packaging and transportation with VM could be made easy, but then, there&#8217;s many virtualization out there to make it work on all, or the most important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removal of built images is easier, as the images are built into the VM. Deleting the VM, deletes all built images. This can also be solved with the tooling, as there is a feature coming that will provide labels to the images created, so every cluster will label their images. Removing the cluster, will remove their images.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Probably there&#8217;s more, but these are the ones I can think of right now.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_options">Options</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are some options out there, some of them more portable, but also, less flexible. As I&#8217;m developing this tool just for me, I focus on something that will work for me, but as I think that most of what works for me could be made work for anyone, I&#8217;m here sharing these thoughts with you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Options:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>CDK, ADB</strong>: Using Virtualization through Vagrant and using vagrant plugins. It&#8217;s portable but very heavy weight and outdated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>OpenShift.org All-in-one</strong>: Same as before. Although it&#8217;s up to date and it doesn&#8217;t use plugins it&#8217;s heavyweight. Even I&#8217;m the author of it, I know it has many limitations, and I&#8217;m just limiting the use of it to those use cases I can not still cover, like doing workshops with Windows users :-(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minishift</strong>: It uses lightweight virtualization, but still don&#8217;t provide many of the additional features I need. I would used it and extend it, but since it&#8217;s written in go, I can not contribute to it. I find this a great option, probably the best. Although I don&#8217;t like the name of the commands used, I think will be the way to move forward, and also it is based on <strong>minikube</strong>, which seems to have adoption on <strong>Kubernetes</strong> community, which is also great. The maintainer is a great guy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plain oc cluster</strong>: This provides a great foundation, but in no way is something usable per se for developers. Just having a default that makes configuration ephemeral is something that for a developer is not interesting. But as the tool is a great cluster bootstrapper, I use it, and try to ask for features that will make developer&#8217;s use case through our tool more interesting and easy. Also the maintainer is a great guy.</p>

</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I love OpenShift, I love Kubernetes. I think it is a great platform to run your containers at scale, but I still see that for developers there&#8217;s a steep learning and usability curve. I hope that one day, Java developers (well really any developer) will deploy locally on Kubernetes/OpenShift and not plain docker. Also that they keep developing in plain Java, using their IDEs, building their artifacts or images however they want (s2i, docker build on OpenShift or maven and docker build locally), but that the proces it&#8217;s easy for them to use.
I think that for them to adopt a platform like this, the development process needs to be:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Easy. Not many additional steps to use the local platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fast. It needs to be as fast as without using the local platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrated. They can use the same tools to work on their local platform.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is one of the required steps to have an environment (local platform) to use. Following should be to be easy to collaborate between your local and remote environments. But that, should be the topic of another post.</p>

<p>In a real world, your applications will be transitioning from environment to environment, from development to testing and into production, as part of their lifecycle. In a container world, applications are assembled into one or many container images, hence what will be promoted are images.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this blog I will demonstrate <a href="http://blog.openshift.com/configuring-your-application-part-1">the concepts we learnt about externalizing configuration</a> in your image promotion scenarios.
As Veer <a href="https://blog.openshift.com/promoting-applications-across-environments/">has previously showed</a>, OpenShift is a platform where we can easily model the concept of stages/environments per application, and we can promote an application (image) from environment to environment just by tagging it accordingly in the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, I will be using the same application I used before, and I will create two projects simulating two different stages/environments for my application:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>node-app-dev</strong> will model the development stage and will be owned by user <strong>dev</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>node-app-test</strong> will model the testing stage and will be owned by user <strong>test</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This application will be deployed with the exact same BuildConfig in both projects, but for each, a different configuration will be used by means of deploying different values in the ConfigMap. dev user, will have an additional task of building the application from source before deploying it.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These commands will create a new project called node-app-dev, as user dev, and will deploy a ConfigMap, with a message and background color that will be used in development environment. Additionally, it will create the deployment configuration for the application and it will build our application from source code.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the process is finished, we will be able to see the result:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, as user <strong>test</strong>, we will create a ConfigMap with different contents,  reflecting our test environment , but we will use exactly the same DeploymentConfig like before.

<p>Kubernetes 1.2, released more than a month ago, has brought many interesting additions to the Kubernetes platform, but there’s one, that relates to configuration management, that’s especially relevant for application developers, this is <a href="http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/configmap/">ConfigMap</a>. In this blog entry I will share some experiences and tips on using ConfigMap that goes beyond what one of our engineers and Kubernetes contributor, Paul Morie, recently <a href="http://blog.kubernetes.io/2016/04/configuration-management-with-containers.html">blogged about it</a>. We will take advantage of this new feature in a real application that we will be promoting through different environments, from development through testing into production.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the challenges that we face as developers is the need to externalize application configuration as this will probably be different per environment or per deployment. In OpenShift, Docker, and Kubernetes, developers have been externalizing this configuration into Environment variables, allowing every deployment to have different values for runtime configuration. This has been a fantastic way to adhere to the third rule of the <a href="http://12factor.net/">12factor</a> methodology, “<a href="http://12factor.net/config">store config in the environment</a>”. When you think that what we, as users of OpenShift, are deploying into the platform is not a container but rather an application, that can be composed of one or multiple containers, we understand that the configuration per deployment really spans greater context than the container itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We need a way of having all the configuration used/needed per application centralized, so that changes in configuration will not impact the definition of the deployment. This is what ConfigMap is for.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The official <a href="http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/configmap/">Kubernetes documentation</a> states:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many applications require configuration via some combination of config files, command line arguments, and environment variables. These configuration artifacts should be decoupled from image content in order to keep containerized applications portable. The ConfigMap API resource provides mechanisms to inject containers with configuration data while keeping containers agnostic of Kubernetes. ConfigMap can be used to store fine-grained information like individual properties or coarse-grained information like entire config files or JSON blobs.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, what type of configuration can we provide to an application or deployment?
It will typically fall under one of these categories:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Single configuration value expressed as an environment variable for the container.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Command line arguments in a container.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple configuration values typically set in a configuration file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s explore how we can use ConfigMaps:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I will demonstrate ConfigMap with a simple node.js app. This application will print a message as body content and will have background color configurable. We will externalize configuration into a ConfigMap. The code for the application is on <a href="https://github.com/jorgemoralespou/ose-app-promotion-configmap/blob/master/node-app/server.js">GitHub</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First required thing is to create a ConfigMap to hold the configuration values you want to make available to the deployment. My node.js application will get it’s background color from a property named “color” in a file named “/etc/node-app/node-app.config” in the container. It will also, look for an environment property named message for a string to be show as background message.
The configuration file contents that will be used is:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">color=blue</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s create a ConfigMap, named <strong>config</strong>, with both a literal text, message=<strong>Hello world!</strong>, and the configuration file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ oc create configmap config \
            --from-literal=message=’Hello world!’ \
            --from-file=ui.properties
configmap "config" created</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s verify the contents of our ConfigMap.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">$ oc get configmap/config -o json
{
    "kind": "ConfigMap",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "config",
    },
    "data": {
        "message": "Hello world!",
        "ui.properties": "color=blue\n"
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
Some internal metadata has been removed from output for brevity.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that I have a ConfigMap with the configuration my application requires, I’m going to deploy an application that will make use of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my <a href="https://github.com/jorgemoralespou/ose-app-promotion-configmap/blob/master/node-app/server.js">sample app</a>, I will consume the configuration provided by the ConfigMap, mapping the ConfigMap property <strong>message</strong> to the environment variable <strong>BACKGROUND_MSG</strong> the application expects, and also mapping the <strong>ui.properties</strong> into a file located in <strong>/etc/node-app/node-app.config</strong>.</p>

<p>Configuration is assembled at deployment time, so when the application is deployed and there is no ConfigMap that satisfies the DeploymentConfig, we will have a warning event in our Event log that will help us diagnose the misconfiguration that prevented the deployment to start:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One important thing to know is, when a ConfigMap is mounted as a volume, we can change the contents of the ConfigMap, and the mounted file in the container will be eventually updated, when the kubelet on the node re-synchs the pod, providing for changes in configuration in running containers. The running application needs to provide a mechanism to reload configuration changes when they happen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this blog we have demonstrated a way of externalizing configuration of an application. Remember, ConfigMaps are GA in Kubernetes 1.2 and OpenShift 3.2 and some improvements are still to come. Just take these simple <strong>restrictions</strong> into account:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>ConfigMaps must be created before they are consumed in pods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ConfigMaps reside in a namespace. They can only be referenced by pods in the same namespace.</p>
